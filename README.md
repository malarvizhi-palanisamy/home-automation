Home Automation is a way to have things around your home happen automatically. The first thing that comes to mind when folks think of home  automation are robots, flashing lights, complicated electronics and a general feeling that their home is less of a warm home and more of a cold science experiment.This device is used to control electronic devices remotely with a mobile app. An Wi-Fi network is used to turn the lights on/off and also to control the other  electric devices like fans, etc.The materials used are ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, Led lights, connecting wires, 1 ohm resistors, bread board. This setup can be used to control the temperature of our home heater, adjust the speed of fan, etc. The level of security of this prototype is based on the security level of the Wi-Fi network used
